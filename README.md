## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- #### Docker Desktop
  ‚û°Ô∏è [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Installation Steps

1. Open a **terminal** and navigate to the directory where you would like to save the repository.

2. **Clone the repository** to your machine by executing the command below in your **terminal**, then proceed with the steps below.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adamratkai/mad-maps.git
   ```

To simplify setup, a `example.env` file is already provided with the necessary **environment variables**, except the **API_KEY**.

#### Docker

1. **Ensure Docker is Running**
    - Start **Docker Desktop** or the **Docker daemon** on your system.

2. **Rename `.env` File**
    - In the repository folder find the `.env` file
    - Rename the `example.env` file to `.env`, simply remove the `example` part.

3. **Add Google API Key**
    - Add your Google API key to the **API_KEY** field in the `.env` file (you can request an api key here: https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial)

4. **Create and Run Docker Container**
    - Execute the following command in your terminal:
      ```bash
      docker compose up --build
      ```

5. **Access the Application**
    - Open your browser and visit:  
      [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6. **Stopping the Application**
   - In your **terminal** press `Ctrl + C`
   - If you want to **stop and remove the containers**, but **keep the database data** for future runs, execute:
     ```bash
     docker compose down
     ```
     In this case, the database will **persist** between runs, and your data will still be available next time you start the application.

   - If you want to **stop, remove the containers and delete the database data**, execute:
     ```bash
     docker compose down -v
     ```
     In this case, the database and all stored data will be completely removed.


## Usage

### Planning your trip

1. **Register** a new account or **log in** if you already have one.

        (e.g., restaurant, hotel, etc.).

4. **Choose from Recommendations**
    - After selecting a location, the app will show the **20 most relevant recommendations**
      based on factors like distance, rating, and category.
